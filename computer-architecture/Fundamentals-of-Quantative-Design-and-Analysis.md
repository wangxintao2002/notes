# Introduction
- Two changes made it easier to succeed with a new architecture(e.g. RISC):
    - The virtual elimination of assembly reduced the need for object-code compatibility.
    - The creation of vendor-independent OS lower the risk of making a new architecture.
- The RISC-based computer raised the performance bar, forced prior architecture to keep up.
    - Intel translated 80x86 instructions into RISC-like instructions internally.
- The hardware renaissance allowed modern programmers to trade performance for productivity.
    - In replace of perf-oriented language like C and C++, much more program today is done in managed language like Java and Scala.
- The limits of power forced the microprocessor industry to use multiple efficient processors instead of a single inefficient processor.
    - Switch from relying solely on ILP to DLP and TLD.
    - DLP and TLP are explicit parallel, a major burden of programmers.
- The improvements of processor performance has slowed down, due to:
    - The slowing of Moore's Law(transistors per chip double every year).
    - The unchanging power budgets for microprocessors.
    - The replacement of the single power-hungry processor with several enegy-efficient processors.
    - the limits to multiprocessing to achieve Amdahl's Law.
- The only path to improve is specialization.
